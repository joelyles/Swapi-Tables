## Project Details for Swapi-Tables

Swapi-Tables is a react application that displays tables with data offered by the _[Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)_.

This project was generated using the npx create-react-app command and with the help of code from my React-Project-02 and React-Project-03 respositories. Those respositories are based on [Dave Gray's React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go). For displaying API data in a table, I was also helped by this [tutorial/article](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/how-to-display-json-data-in-react-table).
